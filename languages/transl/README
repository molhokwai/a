WORKAROUND FOR THE CMS PAGE INTERNATIONALIZATION ISSUE.
-------------------------------------------------------
Content is saved dynamically, and T requires static strings to update translation files.
For now:
 - page saved in app
 - page translation code updated (page_id_xxxxxxxx) in app
 - translations saved though translation files admin
 - page is_translated boolean updated in app
