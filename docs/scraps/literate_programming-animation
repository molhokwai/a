Literate Programming: Animation
------------------------------

The purpose is:
--------------
To be able to draw freehand, or import a freehand drawings (paper or digital) and make an animation.

The logic is: 
------------
To enable a natural way of working:
Commands when it is natural
Visual when it is natural

The description:
--------------- 
The order in which the system related commands appear is not necessarily strict.

Description
-----------
-Into or out of the System: Create drawing
Draw a character, freehand
	Place drawing into scanner or save/copy file

-Into the system: Manage drawing
	Into Command Line:
		Import drawing: System imports and displays drawing
			Nice to have: system looks for latest file/action (file saved, doc in scanner)
		Vectorize
		Map to [reference drawing]: System looks/searches into its library of selected reference 
		drawings for corresponding one or uses the path if path given and pattern matches 
		the given drawing for proportions (length of the arms, size of the head...) 
			Style like [select reference drawing]: Idem, for drawing style
			Edition Commands:
				[select area]: Increase/decrease size, modify color, modify style...
				Nice to have:
					Increase lips size: if system does not know what lip is, system asks, and 
					increases its knowledge
				Switch to Visual
		Into Visual Interface:
			Visual Edition:
				[select area]: increase/decrease size, modify color, modify style...
		Save

	
-Into the system: Animate Drawing
	Into Command Line:
		Animate: System displays frames/timeline
		[Select character]
			Walk left 10s: System fills in frames/timeline
				Pattern matching/Learning: 
					If system does not know what walk means, animation is provided 
					for the system to learn and apply
					If system does not know what left means: walk left & walk right 
					animations are provided, for system to learn left & right
			Frames zoom out: System zooms out of the frames/timeline, displaying 12 
			frames per second, then 6, then 3, then 1
				Nice to have: 
					System selects the most relevant frame(s)
		 	Time x to z: add speech [text]
		Save
		[Select other character]
			Animate: System displays new set of frames/timeline
			Walk left 10s: System fills in frames/timeline
			Frames zoom out: â€¦
			Time w to y: add speech [text]
		Save
		Merge Timelines: System created a new timeline and merges timelines
		Save
		Time x to y: turn character 1 head to character 2
			Pattern matching/Learning:
				If system does not know what turn means, animation is provided for the 
				system to learn and apply	
				If system does not know what turn to mean: turn to & turn 
				from animations are provided for system to learn and apply
		Time w to z: turn character 2 head to character 1
			Learning detail: The system is going to turn the head of character 2 to character 
			1, which means that the head of character 2 should be directed at the center of 
			character 1, and further adjustments needed to direct it to the head of character 
			1
