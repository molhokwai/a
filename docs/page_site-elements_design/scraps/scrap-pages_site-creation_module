Web pages creation module added to cli web:
    >/create/page/[title] (title: allow regular expression '\...')
    >/delete/page/[title]
    >/edit/page/[title]|[id]
    >/create/block/left|right|center|left-top|left-bottom|right-top|right-bottom/page/[title]|[id] (use numbers in the background to have unlimited choices) - (Block => -specific-Element: mathematical element)
    >/edit/block/[title]|[id]/page/[title]|[id].....
    >/add/page/[title]|[id]/group/add/[title]|[id] (Group: mathematical ensemble) - (add # create)
    >/add/page/[title]|[id]/pages/[title]|[id] (Pages => Group)
    >/add/block/[title]|[id]/page/[title]|[id]/pages/[title]|[id]/....
    >/add/block/[title]|[id]/pages/[title]|[id]/...

    >/add/block/[title]|[id]/add/page/[title]|[id]/pages/[title]|[id]/....
    >/add/block/[title]|[id]/add/pages/[title]|[id]/...

Site => Pages
Section => Block
Domain => Site
Pages !=> Page (!: Il existe au moins un...)
Instructions in Instructions work like |ing (piping)

Thoughts:
	- creating a page with a regular expression would logically put the ne page in same sites as pages matching the regular expression, and create a site which's name would be that regular expression and put the page in it.
	  Each action (adding to each site, creating a site) requiring confirmation.

Use pyjs for generation
Save generated as configuration
Add Full Security/Access Option, down to Element.
Translation for commands in all Google Translate available languages
When done: explore way to traduce this purely mathematically (using pyjs combined with gwt2d/gwt3d, with according bridges to translate to xml/html and json, then further without using gwt2d/3d, strictly with mathematics -unless gwt2d/3d offers 'mathematical' api)
