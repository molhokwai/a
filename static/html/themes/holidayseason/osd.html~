							<p>I've done that for years. That is working closed source & with constraints. And I might do it again, if I have no other choice. But then, unless miraculous circumstances, I will be doing it <em>without a smile</em>. Working in <em>classical working 
							environments</em>, with planning, schedules, deadlines & all, has worked well for those who have <em>used</em> me as I've let them use me, and has <u>never</u> worked for me as far as my health was concerned, and I don't expect the classical working 
							environments to have learnt & changed yet (although I've seen at least one case, where that is the case, where the change is in place, maybe partially, maybe totally).</p>
							
							<p>Now I've switched to Ubuntu 9.10 ~a year ago and have only been using any other os when working on another machine than mine since... maybe 9 months now. And I've recently rooted my T-Mobile G1 and installed a most recent version of Android. And it works 
							just like a charm.</p>
							
							<p>So: Open Source works. Free works. And working from wherever I am, whenever I feel like it, doing whatever I feel like, whether it's developing my own ideas, or participating from near or far to an open source project, <em>definetely works for me</em>.</p>
							
							<p>All that not earning a cent out of what I'm doing. Not a cent. And I don't care. But the system that I'm living in, that I have participated in and still are participating in, if only by my presence, cares. And, for now: I care about honouring my 
							engagements. So... </p>
