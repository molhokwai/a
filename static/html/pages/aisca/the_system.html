<blockquote>“Make the best out of the Information in your Data”</blockquote>

<p>Take all the (enterprise) information data that you have right now, at this moment, stored:</p>

<ul>
	<li>On any support: document, audio (speech), video, imaging...</li>
	<li>In any format:  text, office documents, structured database records, email, chat, audio (speech), video...</li>
</ul>

<p>...and turn it into valuable, connected information:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Use <em>intelligent</em> queries to:
		<ul>
			<li>Get any Information you need, and see it at once, all connected, regardless of the format2 </li>
			<li>Get the Information language-independent3, meaning that results in the different languages can be returned by the query</li>
			<li>See all the People connected with the Information</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>From there:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Do some Fine Tuning to get the Information that is most relevant to you:
		<ul>
			<li>Get Alerts (pop-ups, e-mail, sms...) whenever new relevant and interesting Information comes in, from any desired channel4</li>
			<li>Create/Join the Community around the most relevant and interesting Information for you, with details on members’ participation's, involvement, knowledge and expertise...</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
