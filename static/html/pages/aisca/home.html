<blockquote>“The time for the new Information Management Paradigm has come”</blockquote>

<p>Now I’ve been working for years as an Analyst Programmer, and I’ve very soon, when confronted with the reality of Information Management in enterprises, been looking for a way to better manage information. A platform, a system, a framework that would, eventually once and for all, enable enterprises to manage information in a one consistent way.</p>

<p>I’ve even endeavored in designing a search and internet based self learning operating system, and also a randomness based self learning information system interface, potential basis for such a system.</p>

<p>So, I was basically destined to find such a system, sooner or later, but I never expected to find it this soon, and to find it as genial, brilliant, and complete  as it is.</p>

<p>I present it to you here. And if you wish to have more information, or a demo of the system, please use the contact form to send your request. This is a system with high licensing fee, so it this for companies large enough and/or with a large enough volume of data to manage to justify the cost.</p>

<p>If you are a stakeholder, manager, officer in, or collaborator of a large enough company or organization, here is a summary of the direct benefits it can obtain by acquiring a license.</p>

<p>Read on, if you please, and request more information using the contact form, or directly contact me.</p>
